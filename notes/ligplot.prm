Note 1
------
In the "schematic ligand" representation, each peptide-like ligand residue
is represented by a single circle. Only sidechains involved in hydrogen
bonds or hydrophobic contacts with the protein are shown explicitly.

The "schematic" representation for non-ligand residues means that each is
represented by a single box with the residue name and number inside it.

Note 2
------
If accessibility option is selected, the shading behind each ligand atom
will be according to that atom's solvent accessibility. Solvent
accessibilities can be calculated by running the NACCESS program. This
generates a .asa file, and LIGPLOT should then be run on this .asa file in
place of the original .pdb file. If LIGPLOT is run on an ordinary PDB file,
the values in the B-value column will be taken to be accessibilities.

Note that, when running NACCESS you should use the -f and -h flags.

Note 3
------
The non-bonded contacts option determines which non-bonded contacts are to
be included in the plot. The options are:-

     0. Only contacts between hydrophobic atom types (ie carbon/sulphur
        atoms in contact with other carbon/sulphur atoms). This is how
	LIGPLOT defined hydrophobic contacts in versions prior to v.3.2.
     1. A contact between a carbon/sulphur atom and any other atom.
     2. A contact between any pair of atoms - excluding those that are
        hydrogen-bonded.

The distance defining an atom-atom contact is specified by the parameters
to HBPLUS in ligplot.scr and can be changed there if necessary.

Note 4
------
The "Y" option for "Chemical notation" affects the way atom names are
printed. Names on carbon atoms are not given, while for non-carbons only
the element name is shown. The element names are written over the atom
position, hence when the "Chemical notation" option is selected, the
options for printing atoms "as spheres" are automatically set to "N", and
the "Atom Names" option is ignored. The colour of the atom labels is
defined by the appropriate atom colour, as defined in the COLOURS section
below.


LINKED RESIDUES (see Note below)
---------------
HIS-ASP  <- Residue-pair 1
HOH-***  <- Residue-pair 2
         <- Residue-pair 3
         <- Residue-pair 4
         <- Residue-pair 5
         <- Residue-pair 6
         <- Residue-pair 7
         <- Residue-pair 8
         <- Residue-pair 9
         <- Residue-pair 10

Note
----
The above options allow residues that are not directly hydrogen-bonded
to the ligand to be included in the plot, provided they are
hydrogen-bonded to a residue that IS hydrogen-bonded to the ligand.
The residues to be included by their residue type and the non-ligand
residue to which they are H-bonded. For example, `HIS-ASP' will include
any Asp residues that are H-bonded to a His which is H-bonded to the
ligand. More generally, `HIS-***' will show any residue H-bonded to the
HIS. Similarly, `HOH-***' will include any residues in the protein
that are connected to the ligand via a water molecule.
